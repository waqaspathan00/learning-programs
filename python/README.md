# Python Learning Programs
This repo is broken into 3 groups of difficulty:

- Easy - practice syntax
- Medium - practice problem solving
- Hard - put it all together
    
Within each repo you will find a markdown tutorial file containing links to python projects hosted on replit

Once you visit the link, you will see a solution file and a tutorial file

The goal is to achieve what is asked in the tutorial file without using the solution

Once you have completed what you can, take a look at the solution. Whether you were able to solve the problem or not, always take a look at the solution file because there may be something you can learn from it.
