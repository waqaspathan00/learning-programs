This is the WizCode suggested path for learning programming. This methodology can be applied to any and all programming languages. 

## 1. Basics
- Data types - integers, strings
- Printing to console
- Variables and values
- Arithmetic
- Inputs
### Practice apps
- Favorite Color - Create a variable called favoriteColor and assign it your favorite color as a string (e.g., "blue"). Print it to the console.
- Calculate Age - Declare a variable called birthYear, assign it your birth year (as a number), and another variable currentYear for the current year. Subtract birthYear from currentYear to calculate your age, and print the result.
- Greeting Message - Declare two variables, firstName and lastName, and assign them your first and last names. Print a greeting message like “Hello, [firstName] [lastName]!” using console.log.
- Temperature Conversion - Declare a variable celsiusTemp and assign it a temperature in Celsius. Convert it to Fahrenheit using the formula F = (C * 9/5) + 32. Print the result to the console. 
- Math Operations - Create variables for two numbers, num1 and num2. Use console.log to display the results of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of num1 and num2.
- User Input: Greet the User - Use prompt() to ask for the user’s name and store it in a variable called userName. Then, print “Hello, [userName]!” in the console.
- Currency Converter - Use prompt() to ask for an amount in USD. Declare a variable conversionRate and set it to the conversion rate to another currency (like 0.85 for EUR). Calculate and print the amount in the other currency.
- Calculate the Area of a Rectangle - Create two variables, length and width, and assign them values. Calculate the area of the rectangle using the formula area = length * width and print the result.
- Simple Interest Calculator - Create variables for principal (amount of money), rate (interest rate), and time (years). Calculate simple interest with the formula interest = principal * rate * time and print the result.

## 2. Booleans and Conditions
- Data type - boolean
- Conditions and conditional operators
- If statements

## 3. For loops
